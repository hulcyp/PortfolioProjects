<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>How can I minimize CPU and battery usage?</h2>
In general, try to reduce the amount of audio data being pushed through
the system and the amount of resampling that must be done.<br>
<br>All sounds (apart from compressed streams on Android) are resampled
by the Cricket Audio mixer to the output sample rate of 48 kHz.&nbsp; The
mixer has predefined resamplers at some standard sample rates:<br>
<ul>
  <li>8 kHz</li>
  <li>11.025 kHz</li>
  <li>12 kHz</li>
  <li>16 kHz</li>
  <li>22.050 kHz</li>
  <li>24 kHz</li>
  <li>32 kHz</li>
  <li>44.1 kHz</li>
</ul>
Any sounds at these predefined sample rates can be mixed together and
then resampled to 48 kHz, rather than being resampled
individually.&nbsp; So if you will be playing many sounds at once, it
is more efficient if they are all at one of these sample rates.<br>
<br>
Applying pitch shift (or, equivalently, a speed factor) to a sound requires an additional resampling pass for that sound.<br>
<br>
Using mono instead of stereo, and lower sample rate source data, will
decrease the amount of data that needs to be processed; this will lower
your CPU usage, as well as decrease the size of your bank
files, but there may be a loss of audio quality.<br>
<br>
Also, your choice of audio encoding is important.&nbsp; PCM16 and PCM8
are the most efficient; ADPCM is less efficient; and stream formats
such as MP3, MP4, or Ogg Vorbis are the least efficient.&nbsp; (However,
depending on your target platform, there may be hardware support for
decoding some of these stream formats; see <a href="#hardware_support">this FAQ entry</a>.)<br>

<a name="hardware_support"></a>
<h2>Is there support for hardware acceleration of decoding?</h2>This depends on the particular audio encoding, and your platform.<br>
<br>
On iOS, at time of writing, there is hardware support for decoding the following formats:<br>
<ul>
  <li>AAC (MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding)</li>
  <li>ALAC (Apple Lossless)</li>
  <li>HE-AAC (MPEG-4 High-Efficiency AAC)</li>
  <li>MP3 (MPEG-1 audio layer 3)</li>
</ul>
Hardware support is limited to a single stream; additional streams will use software decoding, if available.<br>
For more information, see the iOS <a href="http://developer.apple.com/LIBRARY/IOS/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html">Multimedia Programming Guide</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
On Android, there are no guarantees about hardware support; it is entirely up to the device manufacturer.<br>


<h2>Why can't I load my large bank file on Android?&nbsp; I get an error message about "UNCOMPRESS_DATA_MAX".<br>
</h2>
Android versions prior to 2.3 cannot read compressed assets with an
uncompressed size greater than 1 MB.&nbsp;&nbsp; To get around this
restriction, you can try to break up your bank file into multiple
smaller banks with uncompressed size less than 1 MB, or you can disable
compression for your bank.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To disable compression, if you are building your .apk manually using the&nbsp;<span class="filename">aapt</span> tool, you can use the&nbsp;<span class="filename">-0</span> flag (e.g. "<span class="filename">-0 ckb</span>" to disable compression for bank files with the&nbsp;<span class="filename">.ckb</span>
file extension).&nbsp; However, if you are building your .apk
automatically from Eclipse, there is currently no way to specify this
flag; a workaround is to give your bank file a file extension for
which&nbsp;<span class="filename">aapt</span> already disables compression, such as&nbsp;<span class="filename">.jpg</span> or&nbsp;<span class="filename">.wma</span>.<br>
<br>
See this <a href="http://ponystyle.com/blog/2010/03/26/dealing-with-asset-compression-in-android-apps/">link</a>
for a more detailed description of this problem and its
workarounds.&nbsp; Note that Android versions 2.3 and later do not have
this restriction.<br>
<h2>Why can't I set pitch on MP3 streams on Android<!-- versions prior to 4.0-->?</h2>
Whenever possible, we try to use the Android platform (using the OpenSL
ES API) for decoding of audio, so we can take advantage of any hardware
acceleration present on the device.&nbsp; While the Android platform
provides a way to play compressed streams (e.g. MP3, etc), <!--prior to
Android 4.0, -->it does not provide a way to decompress them into
memory.&nbsp; This means we cannot decompress the data using the
Android platform, and then perform
our own processing with them, so we are limited to using the features
provided by Android itself for compressed streams.<br>
<br>
Cricket Audio can decode Ogg Vorbis audio files using a software decoder on all platforms, if&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkConfig.enableOggVorbis</span> is set to true (which is the default), so pitch adjustment and other processing can be done with those files.<br>
<h2>
Which iOS and Android versions do you support?</h2>
On iOS, Cricket Audio is tested for versions 5.0 and later.<br>
<br>
On Android, Cricket Audio is tested for versions 2.2 and later.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
On Android, note that some features are unavailable depending on the Android version of the device:<br>
<ul>
  <li>In versions prior to 2.3, only .cks and .ogg stream sounds are supported, and network sounds are not supported.</li>
  <!--
  <li>In versions prior to 4.0, there are some limitations on stream sounds in formats other than .cks and .ogg:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>loop points cannot be set at arbitrary points in the stream (only the full stream can be looped)</li>
    <li>speed and pitch cannot be set</li>
    <li>audio callbacks are not supported<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  -->
</ul>

<h2>
How do I determine the URL for an item in the iTunes library for use with CkSound::newAssetStreamSound()?<br>
</h2>Here's some sample code that will create a sound to play an item with a particular title in the iTunes library:<br>
<code>
#import &lt;MediaPlayer/MediaPlayer.h&gt;<br>
<br>
MPMediaQuery *query = [[MPMediaQuery alloc] init];<br>
[query addFilterPredicate:[MPMediaPropertyPredicate
predicateWithValue:@"Some Song Title"
forProperty:MPMediaItemPropertyTitle]];<br>
CkSound* sound = NULL;<br>
if ([query.items count] &gt; 0)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPMediaItem* item = [query.items objectAtIndex:0];
   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSURL* assetUrl = [item valueForProperty:MPMediaItemPropertyAssetURL];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // assetUrl will be nil if track is protected with DRM<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (assetUrl)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound = CkSound::newAssetStreamSound([assetUrl.absoluteString UTF8String]);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}
</code>

<h2>I'm writing a music app for iOS, and am supporting remote control
events.&nbsp; How do I make the play icon in the status bar disappear
when I'm not playing music?</h2>
After calling&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkInit()</span>, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkSuspend()</span>.&nbsp;
This stops audio processing entirely, causing iOS to hide the play icon
in the status bar.&nbsp; When you start to play music, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkResume()</span> to show the icon; when the music stops, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkSuspend()</span> again to hide it.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h2>Why are my banks/streams loading on the iPhone/iPad Simulator, but not on the device?</h2>
File paths are case-sensitive on iOS devices, but not on the simulator; make sure your file paths have the correct case.<br>
<h2>How can I stream audio that is in a proprietary or unsupported data format?</h2>
First, create a subclass of&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkCustomStream</span> that decodes your data into 16-bit signed integer PCM audio data; then call&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkSound::newCustomStream()</span>, passing in an instance of your subclass.<br>
